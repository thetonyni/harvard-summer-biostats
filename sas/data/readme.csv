Federal Coal Ash Rule Groundwater Monitoring Results Database,,
,,
"This database contains groundwater monitoring results from the first ""Annual Groundwater Monitoring and Corrective Action Reports"" posted online in 2018 by coal plants and coal ash dumps that are regulated under the federal Coal Ash Rule. It does not include groundwater monitoring data from un-regulated facilities (i.e. closed ash ponds and landfills), or facilities that have recieved exemptions or extensions for posting groundwater data. It was created by the Environmental Integrity Project with assistance from Prairie Rivers Network, Earthjustice, Sierra Club, Appalachian Voices, and NRDC.

FIELD,DESCRIPTION,
state,The state where the site is located.,
site,The name of the site as it is presented in its groundwater monitoring report.,
disposal.area,The name of the disposal area(s) as they are presented in the groundwater monitoring report. Note: some wells monitor groundwater from more than one disposal unit.,
type,"The type of disposal unit. SI = surface impoundment, L= landfill, M = mixed multi-unit (landfill and surface impoundment), and U = unknown.",
well.id,The identifier given to each monitoring well in the groundwater monitoring report.,
gradient,The location of the groundwater monitoring well relative to the regulated ash disposal unit it monitors.,
sample.date,The date the well was sampled.,
contaminant,The contaminant name. These have been standardized to allow for analyses across plants.,
measurement.unit,"The concentration units. These include mg/l, ug/l, pCi/l, and standard units (SU) for pH.",
below.detection,"""<"" Indicates that a contaminant was not detected. In this case, the value in the ""concentration"" column will be the method detection limit (if known) or the reporting limit. ",
concentration,"The monitoring result (or, for nondetects, the method detection limit or reporting limit).",
qualifier,Lab qualifiers assigned to the result. See each monitoring report for detailed explanations.,
link,The link to the groundwater monitoring report.,
